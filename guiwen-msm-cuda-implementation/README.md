# cuZK: An Efficient GPU Implemetation of zkSNARK

This library is an efficient GPU implemetation of zkSNARK. It contains source code of the paper **cuZK: Accelerating Zero-Knowledge Proof with A Faster Parallel Multi-Scalar Multiplication Algorithm on GPUs** submitted to TCHES 2023.

## Requirement

Our experiments can be finished in the following setup.

1. Ubuntu 20.04
2. CUDA 11.5
3. gcc 7.5.0
4. Nvidia V100 (32 GB)

## Build

First we need to make sure [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-5-0-download-archive) is installed.

Our GPU Implemetation of MSM relies on [`CUB`](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/), which provides state-of-the-art, reusable software components for every layer of the CUDA programming model.

By default, CUB is included in the CUDA Toolkit. 
If there is no CUB after installing the CUDA Toolkit, it is no need to build CUB separately. CUB is implemented as a C++ header library. To use CUB primitives in your code, simply:
1. Download and unzip the latest CUB distribution
2. #include the <cub/cub.cuh> header file in your CUDA C++ sources. 
3. Compile your program with NVIDIA's nvcc CUDA compiler, specifying a -I<path-to-CUB> include-path flag to reference the location of the CUB header library.

After that, we build the library. (It will take some time to compile)
```
cd test
make
```

To run a test of an MSM of `2^20` scale and EC points on the BLS12-381 curve, run:
```
## (It will take some time to run for the first time.)
./msmtestb 20 
```

To run a test of Groth protocol with `2^20` constraint scales and EC points on the BLS12-381 curve, run:
```
## (It will take some time to run for the first time.)
./testb 20
```

For EC points on the ALT_BN128 curve and MNT4, run:
```
## ALT_BN128
./msmtesta 20
./testb 20

## MNT4
./msmtestm 20
./testm 20
```

In addition, our BLS12-377 carve implementation has a Rust binding with the template from [Sppark](https://github.com/supranational/sppark) developed by Supranational LLC. To install the latest version of Rust, first install rustup. Once rustup is installed, install the Rust toolchain by invoking:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable
```

To test BLS12-377 carve implementation.
```
cd test/BLS377
cargo bench
```

## Rusults

Here are a selection of the results tested under NVIDIA V100 GPU card with BLS12-381 curve. More results can be found in the paper cuZK.
